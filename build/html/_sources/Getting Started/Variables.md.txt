# Variables



## What is a variable? 

A variable is a letter, word, etc that you initiate to store some type of value. For starters there are different types of variables a list of them are integers, strings, floats, and boolean values


### The integer variable
To start, we have to use a variable, in our example we will be using 'x' to hold the value of integer 56. To give the variable (x) the value of 56 we do this: 
```python 
x = 56 
```
### To see if 'x' actually has the value of 56, we can print it. 

```python
x = 56
print(x)
```

Extra fact: To do math operations (math operations will be covered in the Math operations section) you will have to use the integer variable




### The string variable
The string variable is where you can store any character, but note that if you store a number, it will not have math operation functions or other integer functions

```python
y = 'Hello World'
print(y)
```

### The float variable
In float variables you can have decimal numbers, something that the integer variable doesn't posses
We will now show you how to use the float variable using variable 'z' and will also print it right after assigning the 
float value of '3432.242'
```python
z = 3432.242
print(z)
```


### The boolean variable
In boolean variables you will be able to store the values of either True or False
We will show you how to use the boolean variable using variable 'a' and will also print it right after assigning the boolean value of 'True'

```python
a = True
print(a)
```
