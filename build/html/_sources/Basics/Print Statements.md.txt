# Print Function

## What is the print function?
A print statement is a [function](../Glossary.html#function) that prints whatever goes into it to the [console](../Glossary.html#console).
The print statement has 1 parameter and it will print out that parameter.
## How do I you use it?
Lets start of by printing Hello World
Since Hello World is a [string](../Glossary.html#string) we need to put quotation marks around it. (We will talk more about [strings](../Glossary.html#string) later).
```python
print("Hello World")
```

> **_NOTE:_** You do not need put a [string](../Glossary.html#string) you can put any [data type](../Glossary.html#datatype).

If you printed this statement, in your [console](../Glossary.html#console) you will see the words 'Hello World'

In the example above you can see that we printed the [string](../Glossary.html#string) 'Hello World'

If you would like to print an [integer](../Glossary.html#integer) you can just put the number in the print statement.

```python
print(5)
```
## Why do I need to know this?
Printing will be used very frequently in python. It can be used for debugging and visualizing your code. In our tutorial we will make use of printing a lot.
